    "As the world is progressing our life routines have become more fast-paced. To aid convenience and save time the concept of ordering out, dining-out has increased to a new level not only for entertainment but it has now become an undeniable necessity. However, it is very important to be aware of the nutritional values of the food we put in our bodies.\n",
    "In the contemporary world, with the rise in trend of consuming highly-processed food, beverages and fast food have caused deteriorating effects on our health. More and more people have faced health problems i.e. Obesity, Diabetes, poor gut health, and other chronic diseases. According to CDC-Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: six in ten adults in the US have a chronic disease and four in ten have 2 or more,  poor nutrition and high sodium and saturated diets along with poor lifestyle are one of the few reasons.\n",
    "To address this issue, it is very important to spread awareness of the importance of healthy food choices. It is our responsibility to take care of our health by consuming nutritious food and mindful food choices."
